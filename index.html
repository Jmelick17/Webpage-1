         <h1>Hello my name is Josh Melick</h1>
          <p>I am a student from Eugene Oregon but moved to Portland Oregon a little over a year ago. I graduated from Lane Community College last spring with an Assosiates of Arts.</p>

      <!--About Me-->
      <section>
        <h1 class="border-top">A Little About My Self</h1>
          <p>I grew up in the somewhat strange town of Eugene, Oregon where I met very intereseting intelectuals that sculped my views for better and for worse. The town taught me at a very young age about the importance of karma and darma and that everything in life has yin and yang, its just all about how you look at it. The town taught me about the importance of spirituality and uplifting the community with possitive energy, something I hope to share with the world. </p> 
            <p>Some of my passions are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Long Hikes in the Rain</li>
              <li>Playing/Listening to Music with My Friends and Family</li>
              <li>Eating Unieque Foods</li>
              <li>Watching Interesting Films</li>
            </ul>
             <p>I have never felt so close to a subject as I do with Web Development, it feels as if the deeper I go down this rabbit hole the better and more satisfying it becomes. So far I really have been enjoying pushing my newly learned skills and looking back at how fast im picking it up. I am so exited to see where this takes me and hope to build strong friendships through hard work with my teamates. I have always loved a project with a strong team because I feel like thats when my skills really shine.</p>
